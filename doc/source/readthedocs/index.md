## Overview

Analytics Zoo is an open source Big Data AI platform (for distributed TensorFlow, PyTorch and keras on Apache Spark & Ray).

---

Analytics Zoo includes the ***Orca*** library that seamlessly scale out your single node Python notebook across large clusters (so as to process distributed Big Data).
